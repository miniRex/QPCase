# QPCase
Program that acts kinda like a shortcut for every picked programs. And in the future maybe it will be able to run more complex things, like a collection of programs, or programs and commands, idk. This thing is actually useful if you don't want your desktop to look like there was a natural disaster, I actually use it in my computer :)

## PROGRESS
- [ ] Elapsed time in program (hours & minutes)
- [ ] Program collections (running a multiple programs at once)
- [ ] Execution commands (not really sure what this will do)
- [ ] Auto data validation (validate the data integrity and fix progrems without manual interaction)
- [ ] More complex visual customization (add things like gradients, animated colors... that kind of things)
- [ ] .jpg custom icons (allow the user to use custom icons with .jpg format)
- [ ] Find programs inside the computer (an option that search through your computer and shows a list of programs to add)
- [ ] Custom option in windows file context menu (show a option like "add program" in the context menu of .exe files)
- [ ] Search option in all programs tab (an option inside all programs tab, that allows to search a program by name)
- [ ] Make a working start with computer option (The current one don't work, so, do it work)
- [ ] Auto format option in advanced config (an option that automaticaly set the text to the correct format, the file conversion already does that, but who cares)
- [ ] Colors in advanced config (add colors to keywords in advanced config, and a option to toggle the colors)
- [ ] Settings visual improvements (improve the settings visuals adding things like lines to divide the options and some more things I don't know now)
- [ ] Auto improve icon quality (this will improve the quality of the default icons, Im not really sure if I can do this, but whatever)
- [ ] Transparency in custom icons (well, right now the custom icons convert the transparent pixels into black pixels, soo I'll fix it)
- [ ] Max custom icon resolution (an option to limit the max custom resolution, this is usefull for better performance)
- [ ] Limit the minimum window transparency (it's anoying puting it to low and not being able to change it because you can't see literaly nothing)
- [ ] Fix start window (for some reason the start window option doesn't work, it will allways open in recent)
- [ ] Disable blur from icons (some option in add window that remove that blur for the icons, idk why whould you do that but whatever)
- [ ] Edit program data (an option to edit an existing program data without deleting it)
- [ ] Custom names (option for using custom names instead of the file name)

I was thinking of some things like showing the recent programs when right click on taskbar, but I don't think that's really usefull.
Well, **any suggestion is welcome**.
